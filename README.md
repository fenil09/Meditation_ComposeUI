Meditation User Interface Developed using Jetpack Compose. This project demonstrates the use of simple composables like Box, Rows and columns and how
we can use them to create simple yet Attractive User Interfaces. This Project also involves implementing the bottom navigation in jetpack compose 
along with the selected item functionality which allows the user to know about the item being selected at a particular point in time.
